Use this tool if entering only a Base Score out of 20.0 with automatic breakdown into 3 Turns categories

Note: When breaking down into the 3 categories, then split is based on Carving 50%, Abs/Ext 25% and Upper Body 25%  (any extra 0.1 increments always added to the Carving Category)

Subsequently you can then use the 3 sliders for Carving, Abs/Ext and Upper Body to further refine your score


This tool  will work with PC, MAC, Android and Apple and will work in Portrait or Landscape mode.  
Sliders should work just fine with Mouse, Touch screen. 
Arrow Up/Down keys on the screen can be held for fast adjustment, or single press Up/Down for fine-tuning by 0.1 point.  
Alternatively in PC and MAC the PgUp/PgDn  and Left-Arrow, Right-Arrow keys will perform similar adjustments.   

Take and look and give me some feedback.

Alternatively there is a simplified tool here that just takes entery for each of the 3 Turns Categories https://freedogski.github.io/basescore/
